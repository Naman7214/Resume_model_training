    <li>The projects section is a great way to showcase your technical skills and abilities. Consider expanding this
      section by including more details about each project, such as your role, responsibilities, and the</li>
    <li>technologies used. Quantify your achievements whenever possible to demonstrate the impact of your work.</li>
    <li>While you have listed some of your skills, consider expanding this section to include additional technical
      skills relevant to web development, such as Bootstrap, React, or Node.js. Additionally, mention any soft skills
      that are valuable in the workplace, such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving.</li>
    <li>It is recommended to include your salary expectations in the resume or be prepared to discuss them during the
