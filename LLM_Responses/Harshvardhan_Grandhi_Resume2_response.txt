      results</li>
    you achieved.

<div class="tailoredRecommendations">
  <h2>Tailored Recommendations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In your work experience section, focus on highlighting your accomplishments and the technologies you used. For
      example, instead of writing "Worked on a project," you could write "Developed a new feature for the company's
      website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript."</li>
    <li>In your skills section, quantify your proficiency in each skill. For example, instead of listing "HTML5," you
      could write "HTML5 (5 years of experience)."</li>
    <li>In your projects section, provide more context about the problem you were solving and the results you achieved.
      For example, instead of writing "Worked on a project," you could write "Developed a new website for a local
