Information Technology Engineering Student
SUMMARY
I am a fourth-year Information Technology Engineering student with a strong foundation in data analysis and a passion for becoming a 
data scientist. My skills include MySQL for data querying and manipulation, as well as Java for backend development. I have gained 
hands-on experience during web development internships, where I effectively collaborated with development teams. In addition to my 
backend skills, I have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows me to create responsive and visually appealing 
data visualizations. I have also worked with statistical analysis tools such as Python utilizing libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data 
manipulation and visualization, and conducting exploratory data analysis. I am also proficient in Tableau and have experience 
connecting Tableau to different data sources, designing intuitive visualizations, and creating interactive dashboards that provide a clear 
understanding of complex data. Moreover, my knowledge of project management and effective communication skills enables me to 
deliver high-quality results and collaborate efficiently with cross-functional teams.
